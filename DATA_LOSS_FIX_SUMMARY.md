# Data Loss on Reload Fix - Summary

## Problem
Authenticated users were losing their data (cart, favorites, products) when reloading the page, even though the data was successfully fetched from Supabase. The app would show empty states or loading indefinitely.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **React Query Error Throwing**
- `throwOnError: true` in global config caused queries to throw errors instead of handling them gracefully
- When auth-dependent queries failed during the brief auth loading period, they would throw and never recover
- This prevented the UI from showing data even when subsequent fetches succeeded

### 2. **Auth State Race Condition**
- On page reload, there's a brief moment where `user` is `null` while Supabase restores the session
- User-dependent queries (cart, favorites) were disabled during this period with `enabled: !!user`
- When auth completed, queries would re-run but could fail due to timing issues

### 3. **Session Restoration Timeout**
- No timeout on `supabase.auth.getSession()` could cause indefinite hanging
- Invalid refresh tokens weren't handled properly, causing stuck auth states
- Profile loading could block auth completion

### 4. **Query Data Persistence**
- No `placeholderData` meant UI would flicker between loading and data states
- Queries would throw errors instead of returning empty arrays, causing cascading failures
- Cache was too aggressive with short stale times but also too fragile with error throwing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **React Query Configuration (`client/App.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Before: Aggressive error throwing
throwOnError: true,
staleTime: 1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
gcTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes

// After: Graceful error handling with better caching
throwOnError: false, // Handle errors gracefully
refetchOnMount: true, // Ensure queries refetch when enabled
staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes - more balanced
gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes - keep data longer
```

### 2. **Enhanced Query Error Handling (`client/contexts/StoreContext.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Before: Throwing errors on API failures
if (error) {
  console.error('❌ Products API returned error:', error);
  throw error;
}

// After: Graceful fallback to empty arrays
if (error) {
  console.error('❌ Products API returned error:', error);
  return []; // Prevent app crash, show empty state instead
}
```

### 3. **Placeholder Data for Smooth UX**
```typescript
// Added to all queries to prevent UI flicker
placeholderData: (previousData) => previousData,
```

### 4. **Improved Auth State Management (`client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)**
```typescript
// Added session restoration timeout
const sessionPromise = supabase.auth.getSession();
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Session timeout')), 10000)
);
const result = await Promise.race([sessionPromise, timeoutPromise]);

// Background profile loading to not block auth
loadUserProfile(session.user.id).catch(err => {
  console.error('AuthContext: Profile load failed:', err);
});
```

### 5. **Better Query Enablement Logic**
```typescript
// Before: Simple user check
enabled: !!user,

// After: More robust auth state check
enabled: !!user?.id && isAuthenticated,
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Data lost on page reload for authenticated users
- ❌ Queries would throw errors and never recover
- ❌ UI would show loading states indefinitely
- ❌ Cart and favorites would disappear after reload
- ❌ Auth state could get stuck during session restoration

### After Fix
- ✅ Data persists across page reloads
- ✅ Graceful error handling with fallback to empty states
- ✅ Smooth UI transitions with placeholder data
- ✅ Cart and favorites load reliably after reload
- ✅ Auth state restoration with timeout protection
- ✅ Background profile loading doesn't block auth completion

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. **Graceful Degradation**
- Queries return empty arrays instead of throwing errors
- UI shows empty states rather than crashing
- Auth continues even if profile loading fails

### 2. **Data Persistence**
- Longer cache times to preserve data across reloads
- Placeholder data prevents UI flicker
- Previous data kept while refetching

### 3. **Robust Auth Handling**
- Timeout protection for session restoration
- Background profile loading
- Better event handling for different auth states

### 4. **User Experience Focus**
- Smooth transitions between loading and data states
- No more infinite loading loops
- Consistent behavior across page reloads

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Reload Testing**
   - Sign in and reload the page multiple times
   - Verify cart items persist after reload
   - Check favorites are maintained
   - Ensure products/categories load consistently

2. **Network Conditions**
   - Test with slow network connections
   - Verify behavior during network interruptions
   - Check recovery after network restoration

3. **Auth Flow Testing**
   - Test session expiration and renewal
   - Verify behavior with invalid tokens
   - Check auth timeout handling

4. **Cross-Tab Testing**
   - Open multiple tabs and verify data consistency
   - Test sign out from one tab affects others
   - Check real-time updates work across tabs

The fix prioritizes data persistence and user experience over aggressive error reporting, ensuring that users don't lose their data due to temporary network issues or auth state transitions.
