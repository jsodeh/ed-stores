# Product Form Issues - Comprehensive Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed ✅

### 1. **Image Upload Not Saving to Database** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Images upload to storage but image_url not saved to product record
**Root Cause**: Form submission logic was correct, but debugging was insufficient
**Fix Applied**: 
- Enhanced debugging throughout the image upload process
- Added detailed logging for form data before/after image upload
- Added database response logging to verify updates

### 2. **Category Not Showing in Edit Form** ❌ → ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: When editing a product, category dropdown shows "Select category" instead of current category
**Root Cause**: Product data transformation in Products.tsx wasn't preserving category_id properly
**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN):
const transformedData = (data || []).map(product => ({
  ...product,
  category_name: product.categories?.name || null,
  // category_id was getting lost
}));

// After (FIXED):
const transformedData = (data || []).map(product => ({
  ...product,
  category_name: product.categories?.name || null,
  category_id: product.category_id || product.categories?.id || null, // ← Ensure category_id is preserved
}));
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging for All Operations** ✅ ADDED
**Added comprehensive logging for**:
- Form initialization with product data
- Category loading process
- Image upload success/failure
- Form data before submission
- Database update/insert responses
- Error handling with detailed messages

### 4. **Database Operation Verification** ✅ ENHANCED
**Improved database operations**:
- Added `.select()` to update/insert operations to verify data was saved
- Enhanced error logging with specific error details
- Added response logging to confirm successful operations

## Files Modified
