# SPA Routing Test Guide

## Issue: Page Not Found on Reload

When you reload pages like `/cart`, `/admin`, `/store`, you get a 404 "Page not found" error instead of the correct page.

## Root Cause

The development server (Vite) isn't properly configured to handle client-side routing. When you reload `/cart`, the browser makes a request to the server for that specific route, but the server doesn't have a route handler for it.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
- Added `appType: 'spa'` for proper SPA mode
- Added custom middleware to handle route fallbacks
- Improved route detection logic

### 2. Enhanced Server Configuration
- Added multiple fallback paths for different deployment scenarios
- Better error messages for debugging

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Navigation
1. Go to homepage: `http://localhost:8080`
2. Navigate to cart: `http://localhost:8080/cart`
3. **Reload the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)**
4. Should show cart page, not 404

### Step 3: Test Other Routes
Test reloading these routes:
- `/store` - Should show store page
- `/admin` - Should show admin dashboard (if signed in as admin)
- `/profile` - Should show profile page
- `/favorites` - Should show favorites page

## If Still Not Working

### Option 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages like "ðŸ”„ Vite SPA: Rewriting /cart -> /index.html"
4. If you don't see these messages, the middleware isn't working

### Option 2: Manual Fix
Add this to your browser bookmarks as a quick fix:
```javascript
javascript:(function(){if(window.location.pathname !== '/'){window.history.replaceState(null, '', '/'); window.location.reload();}})();
```

### Option 3: Alternative Development Approach
If Vite routing still doesn't work, you can:
1. Always navigate using the app's navigation (don't reload pages)
2. Or use the homepage and navigate from there

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- âœ… Reloading any route should work correctly
- âœ… Direct URL access should work (e.g., typing `/cart` in address bar)
- âœ… Browser back/forward buttons should work
- âœ… Bookmarked URLs should work

## Files Modified

1. `vite.config.ts` - Added SPA configuration and middleware
2. `server/index.ts` - Enhanced server-side routing
3. `test-spa-routing.md` - This guide

The fix should resolve the page reload issue for all routes!
