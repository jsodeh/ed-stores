# Netlify Build Fix - Terser Error Resolved

## The Issue ❌
Your Netlify deployment failed with this error:
```
[vite:terser] terser not found. Since Vite v3, terser has become an optional dependency. You need to install it.
```

## Root Cause 🔍
I added `minify: 'terser'` to the Vite configuration for optimization, but Terser isn't installed as a dependency in your project.

## Fix Applied ✅
Changed the minification from `terser` to `esbuild` in `vite.config.ts`:
```javascript
// Before (causing error)
minify: 'terser',

// After (fixed)
minify: 'esbuild', // Use esbuild instead of terser (faster and included by default)
```

## Why This Fix Works 💡
- **esbuild** is included by default with Vite (no extra dependency needed)
- **esbuild** is actually faster than Terser
- **esbuild** produces similar minification results
- No need to install additional packages

## Your Netlify Settings Look Perfect ✅
From your screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ Build command: `npm run build:client`
- ✅ Publish directory: `dist/spa`
- ✅ Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

## Next Steps 🚀
1. **Commit and push this fix** to your repository
2. **Netlify will automatically trigger a new deployment**
3. **The build should now succeed**
4. **Test the SPA routing** after deployment

## Expected Results After This Fix
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ `/cart` page reload works
- ✅ `/admin` page reload works
- ✅ All routes work correctly on Netlify

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Changed minifier from terser to esbuild

The deployment should work perfectly now! 🎉
