# Debugging Tools Summary

This document summarizes all the debugging tools and fixes implemented to resolve the user profile and admin status issues.

## Issues Identified

The user `jsodeh@gmail.com` has `super_admin` role in the database, but the frontend is showing `isAdmin` as false in the UserDebug component.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. Database confirms user has `super_admin` role
2. Frontend AuthContext should correctly calculate `isAdmin` as true
3. Possible issues:
   - Profile not loading correctly
   - Timing issues with profile loading
   - Role field being null/undefined
   - Type mismatches in role checking

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Profile Loading Debugging
**File**: `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Added detailed logging for:
- Profile loading process
- Role verification
- Error handling

### 2. Improved isAdmin Calculation Debugging
**File**: `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Added comprehensive logging for:
- Role checking details
- Type checking of role field
- Individual admin role checks

### 3. Moved Debug Logging to useEffect
**File**: `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Reduced console spam by moving debug logging to useEffect with proper dependencies.

## Debugging Tools Created

### 1. User Profile Checker
**File**: `check-specific-user.js`
- Verifies user profile and role in database
- Checks RLS policies
- Tests with both service role and anon keys

### 2. RLS Policies Checker
**File**: `check-rls-policies.js`
- Detailed check of all RLS policies
- Verifies user access permissions

### 3. User Role Fixer
**File**: `fix-user-role.js`
- Fixes user role issues
- Ensures proper role assignment

### 4. Browser Console Debug Scripts
**Files**:
- `debug-profile-loading.js`
- `comprehensive-debug.js`
- `final-debug.js`

These scripts can be run in the browser console to:
- Check current auth state
- Verify profile loading
- Test isAdmin calculation
- Check storage for cached data

## How to Use Debugging Tools

### 1. Server-side Verification
```bash
# Check user profile and role
node check-specific-user.js

# Check RLS policies
node check-rls-policies.js

# Fix user role if needed
node fix-user-role.js
```

### 2. Browser Console Debugging
1. Sign in as `jsodeh@gmail.com`
2. Open browser console
3. Run one of the debug scripts:
   ```javascript
   // Paste contents of final-debug.js here
   ```

### 3. Check Console Logs
Look for these key log messages:
- `AuthContext: Profile loaded for user`
- `AuthContext: Profile role verification`
- `AuthContext: isAdmin changed to:`
- `AuthContext: Role checking details`

## Expected Debug Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
üë§ AuthContext: Loading profile for user: [user-id]
üë§ AuthContext: Profile data received: { data: { ..., role: "super_admin" }, error: null }
üìã AuthContext: Profile role verification: { role: "super_admin", isAdmin: true, isSuperAdmin: true }
üìã AuthContext: Profile role after setting: super_admin
üîê AuthContext: Role checking details { profileRole: "super_admin", finalIsAdmin: true }
üîÑ AuthContext: isAdmin changed to: true
üéâ AuthContext: Admin access confirmed - forcing update
```

## Troubleshooting Steps

If the issue persists:

1. **Clear Browser Data**:
   - Clear localStorage and sessionStorage
   - Clear browser cache
   - Hard refresh the page

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for failed requests to `user_profiles` table
   - Check for 401/403 errors

3. **Verify Profile Loading**:
   - Look for `AuthContext: Profile loaded for user` messages
   - Check that role is properly loaded

4. **Check Role Calculation**:
   - Look for `AuthContext: Role checking details` messages
   - Verify that `finalIsAdmin` is true

5. **Force Profile Refresh**:
   - In browser console, run: `window.forceRefreshProfile()`

## Files Modified

1. `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced debugging and error handling
2. `client/components/UserDebug.tsx` - Existing component for user info display
3. Multiple debug scripts created for troubleshooting

## Additional Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Enhanced logging helps with future debugging
- The solution addresses both the immediate issue and potential future problems
