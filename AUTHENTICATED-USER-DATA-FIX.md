# Fix for Authenticated User Data Loading Issues

## Problem Description

When users are **not signed in** (anonymous), the application successfully loads and displays products and categories. However, when users **sign in**, the data disappears and fails to load properly.

## Root Cause Analysis

From the console logs, we can see that:

1. **Products and categories load successfully** for both anonymous and authenticated users
2. **User-specific data fails to load** for authenticated users with 500 errors:
   - Cart items: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500`
   - Favorites: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500`
   - User profiles: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500`

The issue is **missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies** for the `favorites` and `user_profiles` tables. While the app has RLS policies for `products`, `categories`, and `cart_items`, it's missing policies for the other user-specific tables.

## Console Log Analysis

```
✅ Products query without filters succeeded - 32 products loaded
✅ Categories query without filters succeeded - 7 categories loaded
❌ Cart API Error: 500 error
❌ Error loading profile: 500 error  
❌ Error loading favorites: 500 error
```

The products and categories load successfully because they have proper RLS policies, but the user-specific data fails because the tables lack the necessary security policies.

## Solution

### Files Created

1. **`fix-missing-rls-policies.sql`** - Fixes only the missing policies for favorites and user_profiles
2. **`complete-rls-fix.sql`** - Comprehensive fix with all RLS policies for all tables

### What the Fix Does

The SQL scripts create the missing RLS policies:

#### Favorites Table Policies
- Users can view their own favorites
- Users can add favorites
- Users can remove favorites

#### User Profiles Table Policies  
- Users can view their own profile
- Users can create their own profile
- Users can update their own profile
- Users can delete their own profile

### How to Apply the Fix

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Go to the SQL Editor**
3. **Run one of the SQL files**:
   - For a quick fix: Run `fix-missing-rls-policies.sql`
   - For a complete solution: Run `complete-rls-fix.sql`
4. **Test the application** by signing in and verifying that data loads properly

## Expected Results After Fix

After applying the RLS policies:

1. ✅ **Anonymous users**: Products and categories load successfully (unchanged)
2. ✅ **Authenticated users**: Products, categories, cart, favorites, and profile data all load successfully
3. ✅ **No more 500 errors** for user-specific data queries
4. ✅ **Proper data display** in the UI for authenticated users

## Technical Details

### RLS Policy Structure

Each policy follows this pattern:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "policy_name"
ON table_name FOR operation
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = auth.uid()); -- or id = auth.uid() for user_profiles
```

### Security Considerations

- All policies use `auth.uid()` to ensure users can only access their own data
- No public access is granted to user-specific tables (favorites, user_profiles, cart_items)
- Products and categories remain accessible to both public and authenticated users

## Verification

After running the fix, you can verify it worked by:

1. **Check the console logs** - No more 500 errors for user-specific queries
2. **Sign in to the application** - Data should load and display properly
3. **Test user-specific features** - Cart, favorites, and profile should work correctly

## Files Modified

- `fix-missing-rls-policies.sql` - New file with missing RLS policies
- `complete-rls-fix.sql` - New file with comprehensive RLS policies
- `AUTHENTICATED-USER-DATA-FIX.md` - This documentation file

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the core issue where authenticated users couldn't see data in the application. The problem was not with the frontend code but with missing database security policies that prevented authenticated users from accessing their own data.
