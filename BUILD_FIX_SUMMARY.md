# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The build failed with the following error:
```
The symbol "getStatusIcon" has already been declared
```

## Root Cause
When updating the `OrderTrackingModal.tsx` component, I accidentally created two functions with the same name `getStatusIcon`:

1. **Line 108**: `getStatusIcon(step: number, currentStep: number)` - Used for timeline step icons
2. **Line 127**: `getStatusIcon(status: string)` - Used for status badge icons

This created a naming conflict that caused the TypeScript/ESBuild compilation to fail.

## Solution
Renamed the second function to avoid the conflict:

### Before (Conflicting):
```typescript
const getStatusIcon = (step: number, currentStep: number) => { ... }
const getStatusIcon = (status: string) => { ... } // ❌ Duplicate name
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
const getStatusIcon = (step: number, currentStep: number) => { ... }
const getStatusBadgeIcon = (status: string) => { ... } // ✅ Unique name
```

### Updated Usage:
```typescript
// Changed from:
{getStatusIcon(userOrder.status || 'pending')}

// To:
{getStatusBadgeIcon(userOrder.status || 'pending')}
```

## Files Modified
- `client/components/OrderTrackingModal.tsx`

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript diagnostics pass
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes to functionality

## Prevention
This type of error can be prevented by:
1. Using unique, descriptive function names
2. Running local builds before deployment
3. Using TypeScript strict mode to catch naming conflicts early
4. Code review to catch duplicate declarations

The fix maintains all the functionality while resolving the naming conflict that was preventing deployment.
