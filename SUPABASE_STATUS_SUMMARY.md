## Recommendations

### 1. Monitor Performance
- Watch for any new loading issues in production
- Monitor React Query cache behavior
- Check real-time subscription performance

### 2. Data Management
- Consider adding more product categories for better organization
- Ensure product images are properly configured
- Monitor inventory levels if stock management is implemented

### 3. Error Handling
- The circuit breaker pattern is in place for API failures
- Auth timeout handling prevents infinite loading states
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: The app is ready for deployment
2. **User Testing**: Test the loading fixes with real users
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for query performance
4. **Data Backup**: Ensure regular database backups are configured

## Files Modified in This Session

1. `client/lib/supabase.ts` - Fixed TypeScript query type inference error
2. Created temporary connection test (removed after verification)

The Supabase data layer is now fully functional and optimized for your e-commerce application.
